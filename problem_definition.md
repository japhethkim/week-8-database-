## SDG Goal 7: Affordable and Clean Energy
### Problem Definition
The issue of affordable access to clean energy in rural areas is a critical problem under SDG 7. Rural communities, particularly in developing countries, often face limited access to renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydro power. This problem not only affects the well-being of individuals but also hinders economic development and environmental sustainability.

Specifically, we aim to analyze the cost disparity of clean energy across regions, focusing on how the lack of affordability impacts both the economic and environmental well-being of rural areas compared to urban ones. By collecting and analyzing data on energy costs and impact, we can identify gaps and propose actionable solutions.
